      <h2>What is a Pomodoro?</h2>
      <h4>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management scheme created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It was created to enhance work productivtity and efficiency, and to help users break down and better tackle large and potentially intimidating tasks. It revolves around the breaking up of time into 25-minute intervals, called <i>pomodoros</i> (Italian for "tomatoes") after the tomato-shaped cooking timer Cirillo used in university.</h4>
      
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <h4>Working time is broken up into 25-minute pomodoros, punctuated by 5-minute breaks in-between. One is to determine a specific task or problem to be accomplished in a set of four pomodoros, each set being seperated by a longer break. It's a good idea to keep track of your pomodoros and sets and record to work done in each for later self-reflection. As the technique is designed to keep you on task, there are no pause buttons.</h4>
